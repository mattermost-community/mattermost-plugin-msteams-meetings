# Enviroment

This plugin contains both a server and web app portion. Read our documentation about the [Developer Workflow](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-workflow/) and [Developer Setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-setup/) for more information about developing and extending plugins.

## Server

Inside the `/server` directory, you will find the Go files that make up the server-side of the plugin. Within there, build the plugin like you would any other Go application.

## Web App

Inside the `/webapp` directory, you will find the JS and React files that make up the client-side of the plugin. Within there, modify files and components as necessary. Test your syntax by running `npm run build`.
