## Starting a call

Use the ``/connect`` slash command to connect.

Start a call either by clicking the header button or the start slash command. Every meeting you create will create a new meeting room in MS Teams. If two meetings are created really close (less than 30 seconds) you will get a prompt asking you whether you are sure you want to create the meeting.

## Disconnecting an account

Use the ``/disconnect`` slash command to disconnect the account.
