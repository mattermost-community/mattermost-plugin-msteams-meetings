## Connecting an account

Use the `/mstmeetings connect` slash command to connect.

## Starting a call

Start a call either by clicking the header button or the `/mstmeetings start` slash command. Every meeting you create will create a new meeting room in MS Teams. If two meetings are created really close (less than 30 seconds) you will get a prompt asking you whether you are sure you want to create the meeting.

## Disconnecting an account

You can disconnect your MS Teams account from Mattermost using the `/mstmeetings disconnect` slash command.

To connect another account to Mattermost, follow the configuration instructions again. If you are disconnecting in order to refresh the token, then use `/mstmeetings connect` to reconnect.
